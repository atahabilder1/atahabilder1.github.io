Welcome to my blog! I'm Anik Tahabilder, a PhD student at Wayne State University specializing in blockchain technology and machine learning.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Research Updates**: Progress on my smart contract security research and ML-based audit tools
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed explanations of blockchain concepts and machine learning algorithms
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on topics like Solidity development, Python ML libraries, and data science workflows
- **Thoughts on Web3**: My perspectives on the evolving blockchain ecosystem

## My Research Focus

My current research focuses on developing an AI-powered Smart Contract Audit Tool that leverages Machine Learning to enhance the security and reliability of blockchain-based smart contracts. This includes:

1. Static and dynamic analysis techniques for vulnerability detection
2. Natural Language Processing for contract logic analysis
3. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for transparent security findings
